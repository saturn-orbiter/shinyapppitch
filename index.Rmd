### Your Normal Distribution

Would you like to a see a plot of normal distribution whose parameters you can change?

Would you like to see geometric interpretation of the probabilities computed under the distribution?

Then here is a short presentation of the application.

### The Application
If you go to the application's web site, this is what you will see, the plot of standard normal distribution:

<img src="assets/img/home.png" height="400" width="600" />

--- .class1 #id2 bg:wheat

### Supply your own parameters!
Here is what happens when you change some parameters/inputs:

### A Few Usual Probabilities
If you want to know the value of a typical probability of some range, say, P[a<X<b] given that the mean and standard deviations are set 6 and 1.0, and a and b are set to 4 and 7, respectively, the application will compute it for you (rounded off) as:

```{r probs, echo=FALSE}
m <-6
sd <-1.0
a <- 4
b <-7
p1 <- pnorm(a, mean=m, sd=sd)
p2 <- pnorm(b, mean=m, sd=sd) - p1
p2 <- round(p2,4)
str1 <-paste0("P[",a,"<X<",b,"]") 
print(paste(str1, "=", p2))
```
